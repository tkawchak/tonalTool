#Tonal Tool

Program to give directional audio information to visually impaired users in a grocery shopping scenario for use with the Third Eye Project.

#Usage

Camera is only supported using OpenCV version 2.x.  Otherwise, you can get a feel for the application by running it without the video.  A user is required to give the directional feedback to the visually impaired person by indicating the correct direction to move.
